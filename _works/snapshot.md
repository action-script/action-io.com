In the midst of the global pandemic caused by covid-19, Transmediale celebrates the Vorspiel 2021, and due to the lockdown conditions, Lacuna Lab proposes an entirely digital program.

Nuño de la Serna present snapshot, a series of film interviews that reflect a momentary snapshot in the life of Lacuna Lab and its members. These interviews take a record of the artworks presented by the members during Vorspiel along with their individual backgrounds, influences, and points of view.



*The 8 video interviews will be released along the period of the festival prior to each artist's act.*
